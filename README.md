<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A Pythonic library to help people work with the Transport for London (TfL)
REST API. It provides a lightweight API wrapper class and an interactive
visualization component using the Bokeh library. The intent of this library is
to make interacting with the API much easier for new Python users, extend the
current capabilities of the API and provide sufficient error handling.

### Built With

- [Python 3.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-375/)
- [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html)
- [TfL Unified API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/)
