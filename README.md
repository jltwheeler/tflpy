# TflPy

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Lightweight Pythonic API wrapper for working with the [Transport for London
(TfL) REST API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/). The intent of this library is to
make interacting with the API much easier for new Python users, extend the
current capabilities of the API and provide sufficient error handling.

### Built With

- [Python 3.7.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-375/)
- [TfL Unified API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/)
